# homebrew-stanford

Some maybe-useful Stanford-specific homebrew packages.

## Install

You must "tap" homebrew-stanford before you can use it:

```bash
$ brew tap scottylogan/homebrew-stanford
```

This only needs to be done once. Once tapped, "brew update" is enough
to update it.

Once tapped, use the `scottylogan/homebrew-stanford/<pkg>` prefix
whenever you need to install a package:

```bash
$ brew install scottylogan/homebrew-stanford/netdb-cli
```
